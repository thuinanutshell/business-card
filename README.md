# A Slider Business Card
I've learned to use Flickity to create a card carousel that has an effect like a slider. There are obviously many other options that I can do the same thing, like using HTML-CSS only, but I felt like I understood the Flickity approach the most, so I opted for it. What I learned is that when looking for solutions online, at least for me, I'll only choose to follow the one that I understand (which also applies to when I use LLMs).
